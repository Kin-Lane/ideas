<p>I use screenshots across the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/network.html">API Evangelist network</a>. I take screenshots of stories I curated, companies I track on and API developer areas I'm monitoring. Historically I've used a variety of screenshot APIs, to generate the 1000's of screenshots I need to make my network function.</p>
<p>This last week I was running through my network, and noticed the screenshot API had stopped working. It isn't a critical piece of infrastructure so I've used free services and don't really feel the need to monitor in real-time, I just respond when I stop seeing screenshots on the news listing page.</p>
<p>This is the 3rd or 4th time this has happened, and when I started looking for a new screenshot API I noticed the majority of them now charge, and was in a range I just didn't feel I couldn't afford being a one man show. I knew in the back of my mind that I could develop my own screenshot API solution.</p>
<p>After test driving several image libraries I settled in with <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a>, which allows me to load and manipulate web pages in an object, and then take a screenshot of the web page in that state. I quickly wrapped in a web API using the Slim Framework in PHP.</p>
<p>Once I had the API deployed I wrapped with my <a title="3Scale API Management Infrastructure" href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API management infrastructure</a>, which requires an API key before you can use any of my APIs. Next I updated my company, API and news screenshot tool to use my new screenshot API.</p>
<p>After I get some free time I will clean up the code and publish via Github, so others can deploy their own screenshot API and take the same path I chose.</p>
