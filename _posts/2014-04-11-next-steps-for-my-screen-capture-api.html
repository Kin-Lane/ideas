<p>Earlier this year <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2014/01/06/creating-my-own-screenshot-api/">I created a screen capture API</a>, filling a need I have across my network&mdash;capturing an image snapshot of any web page. Not all APIs are created the same, but I think this screen capture API represents a very fundamental layer of the API economy, the utility API. This API isn't Twitter or Google Maps, it does one thing and it does it well&mdash;something most APIs should work hard to achieve.</p>
<p>I've been using my screen capture API internally for several months now, and I think it is time to do more with it. I want to make this API available publicly, but I don&rsquo;t want to just make freely available to anyone on the open Internet, to use as much as they want. I want to create an access layer, using <a href="http://bit.ly/13esk6Q">3Scale API infrastructure</a> management that allows me to control who has access, and what they can, or cannot do with it.</p>
<p>To help me plan the next steps for my screen capture API I'm working on:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Service Composition - An outline of the different ways I will sell access to my screen capture API</li>
<li>Operational Harness - An overview of how I will deliver these API services to my target customers</li>
</ul>
<p>My goal in all of this is to generate stories for API Evangelist, but I also want to push forward my own understanding of how API resources can be delivered, and what better way than providing my own APIs. I have a number of other APIs I would consider very utility in nature, that I want to launch, but I&rsquo;m going to focus on just the screen capture API for now, and try to establish a blueprint I can use across all of my APIs.</p>
<p>I will publish my screen capture API service composition and operational harness as separate blog posts. Then I will look at actually deploy the API in accordance with my service composition, and establish an operational platform in sync with my operational harness. I won't post every update here on API Evangelist about this work, you will have to visit my <a href="http://screen-capture.apievangelist.com/">screen capture API project</a> to find those updates.</p>
